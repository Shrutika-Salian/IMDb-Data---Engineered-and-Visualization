▪ Staging – load data from data sources<br />
▪ Integration – load into a dimensional model that provides data consistency<br />
▪ BI Schemas – create one or more BI schemas tailored to specific types of analysis<br />
▪ BI Dashboards - create interactive dashboards to analyze movies, TV episodes, actors/actresses, show runtimes and so on.<br /><br />
