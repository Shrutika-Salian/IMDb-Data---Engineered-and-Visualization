The above Analytica Data Architecture (ADA) consists of following steps:
▪ Staging – load data from data sources
▪ Integration – load into a dimensional model that provides data consistency
▪ BI Schemas – create one or more BI schemas tailored to specific types of analysis
▪ BI Dashboards - create interactive dashboards to analyze movies, TV episodes, actors/actresses, show runtimes and so on.

Tasks Performed in Detail:
• Designed Data Warehouse for the IMDb Database <br />
• Pipelined and staged largescale data from multiple database sources and integrated into one database using TALEND <br />
• Profiled, cleansed, and integrated the data using ALTERYX and TALEND <br />
• Engineered ETL workflows to integrate data into facts & dimensions using Talend <br />
• Optimized 70+ ETL jobs ensuring one-click load using master job and parallelization <br />
• Built effective data integration workflows for loading data of 5-10GB into target data warehouse with record time:
1 hour 47 mins (32 mins staging + 50 mins facts & dimensions + 25 mins for 3 BI Schemas) <br />
• Visualized the data using TABLEAU and POWERBI, created interactive dashboards highlighting critical KPIs <br />

Source Databases & Files: MS Sql Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, .csv & .tsv files <br />
Target Data Warehouse and Staging: MS Sql Server <br />
BI Schema Databases: MS Sql Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL <br />
Tools: DBeaver, SMSS, PgAdmin, Talend, Alteryx, PowerBI, Tableau
